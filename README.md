## 🔮 Overview

**ResuMaster Pro** is a next-generation resume analysis platform powered by Google's Gemini Pro model. It deconstructs your professional profile using neural ingestion and reconstructs it to align perfectly with target market benchmarks.

> **"Quantum Cluster Secured"** — Your data is processed in a secure, ephemeral context.

## ✨ Core Features

*   **🧬 Neural Ingestion**: Parses complex PDF and DOCX structures using advanced extraction algorithms.
*   **🧠 Semantic Logic**: Maps your latent skills and experiences to market demands, not just keywords.
*   **🛡️ Secure Processing**: Client-side parsing with `pdf.js` and `mammoth` ensures your documents stay private until analysis.
*   **🎨 Premium UI**: A "Quantum" aesthetic with glassmorphism, 3D card effects, and responsive motion layout powered by `framer-motion`.
*   **⚡ Flash Engine**: Built on Vite for millisecond-latency performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 (PostCSS), Custom Animations
*   **AI Engine**: Google Gemini Pro (`@google/genai`)
*   **Parsing**: `pdfjs-dist`, `mammoth.js`
*   **Visualization**: Recharts, Framer Motion

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js 18+
*   A Google Gemini API Token

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Cluster**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ROHITH-NATHANI/ResuMaster-Pro.git
    cd ResuMaster-Pro
    ```

2.  **Ignite Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Secure Configuration**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_TOKEN=your_actual_api_token_here
    ```
    > ⚠️ **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file. It is already added to `.gitignore`.

4.  **Launch Sequence**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Access the interface at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📦 Building for Production

To optimize the neural net for production deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles TS, optimizes CSS (PostCSS), and bundles assets into `dist/`.
